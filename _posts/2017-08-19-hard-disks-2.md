Hello Everyone !!! This is a continuation from my previous post where I simulated behavior of hard disks in a given 2-D space using Newtonian deterministic mechanics. If this is the first time you're hearing about **`Hard disks`** I suggest you read my previous post (`Simulation of Hard Disks : Part 1`)[] where I explain the basics of these sort of simulations and the rational to even attempt them in the first place.

 So continuing from my previous post today I'll be focusing on  simulations of hard disks which utilize the concept of randomness. But first, **_Why do even need some other technique?_**ckuo

 If you read my previous post on hard disks, you'd notice that the code itself was pretty complex even though the simulation had only 4 disks.


 The reason behind this complexity is because we needed to solve the equations related to the motion for all the disks in our defined space. But when we actually need to predict behavior of entities like gases, there are thousands or millions of particles(Disks), so the computational complexity increases exponentially as well.

##### So until next time,
##### Cheers!
