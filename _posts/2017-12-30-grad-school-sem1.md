Hello Everyone!! With 2017 coming to an end like most of your'l I've also started to reflect on what happened in this year. It's been almost six months since I moved to USA and started grad school. I fondly recall my first semester in university back in Sri Lanka, my years in school at st.Joseph's and similarly I'd have the same recollection of my first semester in graduate school in years to come. 

##### So until next time,
##### Cheers!
