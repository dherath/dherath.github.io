Hi All! Today I thought of writing about some research work that I did as part of my PhD. The goal of this project was aimed at improving the credibility and reproducability of scientific research. Falsified research findings can have serious implications in many areas, for example imagine if fradulant research was used for drug discovery for some desease, then it could have serious side effects for any patient that use those drugs. Or imagine a governmental policy decision was carried unknowingly based on some fradulent research, this again could have serious negative implications to the society at large. Therefore, ensuring that research is credible and reproducible is of great importance in the research community [[1](https://nbakay.wordpress.com/2018/10/06/peer-reviewed-scientific-research-losing-credibility-as-studies-show-they-are-rigged-or-false/),[2](https://www.press.umich.edu/9717920/fraud_and_misconduct_in_research).  The work I have done is aimed at improving the credibility of a cyber-infastructure called scientific workflows that is used as a computational resource by many scientist when they need to conduct large scale complex computations. For example, scientific workflows are used for detecting possible locations for earthquakes, computational drug discover or diagnosing a patients illness.

#### What are Scientific Workflows ?

<!-- what are sciflows? how are they attacked  -->

Basically, a scientific workflow is a cyber-infastructure used to facilitate collaboration between scientists across different geographical locations. Think of a scientific workflow as a combination of sequential tasks like a flowchart that needs to be carried out inorder to get results from some experiment. Imagine that each of those tasks require massive computations. The image below is an example of a scientific workflow used for gene conversion analysis. So by using a scientific workflow, a scientist can offload the computational tasks to the cloud and also share the results with other scientists. In terms of reproducability, by sharing the same workflow any other scientist should be able to reproduce the same result. 



However as shown in the same image, it is possible for some malicious person to change the structure and computational order of a workflow and get a fraudulant result. These sort of malicious activity could be motivated by a variety fo reasons, **1)** One disgrunted member of the research team or some person might want to sabotage the entire research effort, **2)** to bloat the actual research findings such that it will get easily accepted to a refferred publication or used in actual policy making. To that end, we developed a novel Machine Learning model called **RAMP** that is able to identify malicious activity or anomalies in scientific workflows in real-time.
