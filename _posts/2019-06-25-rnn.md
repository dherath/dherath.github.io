Hi All! Today I thought of writing an introductory post on a very popular topic namely **Deep Learning**,  which is a branch of machine learning that extends from _neural networks_. In recent years you probably have heard about _AI_ beating players in quite complex games like [GO](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/) and [DOTA](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/13/18309459/openai-five-dota-2-finals-ai-bot-competition-og-e-sports-the-international-champion) and probably thought its really cool that computers `or` rather deep learning models have come all this way.

Deep Learning has been used in many application domains from image and video processing to time series forecasting and creating autonomous agents that could say play games. Now, to be very specific I will be talking about a subset of deep learning models that are specifically designed to work with time series data. Refering to the image up top these models can be grouped together into whats called **Recurrent Neural Networks**.

##### So until next time,
##### Cheers!
