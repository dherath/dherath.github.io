Hello Everyone, My name is **_Jerome Dinal Herath_** and welcome to my blog! I graduated from **University of Colombo with a specialization in Computational Physics** and now in the processes of migrating to _Computer Science_ for my PHD. Iâ€™m natively from **Sri Lanka**, a beautiful tropical island in the middle of the Indian ocean. If you don't know anything about Sri Lanka  click 
[here](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/sri-lanka){:target="blank"} & if you plan on visiting a tropical paradise you would love Sri Lanka. Most of what I'll be writing in my blog would be related to my course work, research and anything related to technology that I find interesting.

#### Happy Reading!
#### Cheers!
