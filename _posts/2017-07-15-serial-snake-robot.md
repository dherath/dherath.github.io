I've always been fascinated by robots and well snakes. When it came to selecting a theme for my undergraduate research project I naturally ended up selecting an option which fits well with both. What started out as a research project sort of ended up being one my hobbies, so I'll time and again update on my snake robot progress through my blog.

Now first to start off, essentially what I have been trying to do is to replicate serpentine motion in robots using simulations. Note that none of the methods I have developed have been experimentally tested. Maybe I'll do it someday but there is still a long way to go before that... u'll see why.

#### Prerequisites (Skip if you've used Gazebo or know some robotics)

Before I go further into what I've done, here are some things you'll need to know.
1. All my simulations were carried out using **Gazebo**, an open source software platform widely used in robotic simulations. Simulations are a cool way of testing out new ideas with minimal cost, and  its way more cooler since it involves robots. If you've never used Gazebo then click [here](http://gazebosim.org){:target="blank"}. The official website has all the instruction on how to install Gazebo and tutorials on how to get started.
2. Also you'll need to have some idea about robotics in general. [Theory of Applied Robotics: Kinematics, Dynamics and Control](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Applied-Robotics-Kinematics-Dynamics/dp/1441917497){:target="blank"} is a great book you could use as a reference, but for now just knowing how to use Gazebo would be sufficient to understand what I've done.
