Hello Everyone !! Sorry I was MIA **:)**, as you all probably know if you read my previous posts I've just started grad school and while everything I learn here is extremely interesting it's kind of a grind so I haven't had time to write anything new. Now coming back to my post a lot of my friends and students from my home country Sri Lanka have been asking about my experience about switching fields from Computational Physics to Computer Science. To those who don't know I have a bachelors degree in Computational Physics and I switched to Computer Science for my PHD.

This post is for you if you're a **student following a bachelors degree or someone who just finished a degree and planing to apply for grad school, but don't really like your current field and wants to switch**. Now first of all switching fields is not an easy thing, and it requires a lot of planing and preparation. But thats not the hardest part, the `hardest part is deciding that you want to switch`. Because most everyone you will meet or ask advice from would tell you it's risky and hard. **Yes** it is _risky and hard_ but not impossible. I decided for my own personal reasons to switch fields back in 2015 and it was one of the best decisions I've taken so far amidst a bunch of horrible ones.

>Disclaimer: like any form advice, what I'll be telling today is 30% actual advice and 70% from my own experience. So some things may or may not apply to you, so do take everything with a grain of salt.

Now back to my post. If you _googled_ a bit on `steps for applying for a PHD` you would get a considerable number of results containing a lot of useful advice. However, its my opinion that the same approach doesn't work for everyone simply because we are at different stages of life(_by life I mean different years at university_) when we do decide to apply for a PHD. So depending on what stage of your bachelors degree the approach to prepare for the application process would change. Now obviously I'll be making some assumptions about you, since even my advice shouldn't be applied to all cases.

## Assumptions about you

1. You really _really_ want to do a PHD. This ones a given, because if you didn't you wouldn't be reading this.
2. You are thinking of switching fields, but unsure if thats possible. Now, what I'll be telling will relate mostly to a switch to **Computer Science**, but some of it might be applicable to other fields as well.
3. You are a student following a bachelors degree(_maybe masters, but it's geared towards bachelors more_) **OR** just completed one.

### Case 1 : You're a Freshman (1st year) or a Sophomore (2nd year)

If you are a Sophomore or a Freshman my biggest advice is to focus on grades. There is a debate about the influence GPA has on your application. Because most PHD candidates would agree that grades alone wouldn't be enough. Now heres the catch, GPA has a disproportional impact on your application. Say you have an amazing GPA(4.0/4.0), thats great while it wouldn't ensure you're success at getting in it certainly is positive. However lets say your GPA is 2.0/4.0 then it definitely would have a negative impact on your application.

GPA isn't really a measure of your intelligence(_well to a certain extent it is_), but its more an indication of your dedication and capacity to plan and work. PHDs aren't achieved in a couple of months, it usually takes years. So they definitely check for an applicants ability to persevere. Your cumulative GPA is a summation of 4 years, and the fact that you have been able to maintain it shows you have **focus** and thats essential for a PHD.

`In a nutshell if you are a freshman or Sophomore focus on your grades`. You don't need to worry about what area you want to apply for or the universities you'd want to attend for grad school. Because a lot of things change, I remember back when I was in 1st year I wanted to specialize in **chemistry** and look where I am now. :)

## Case 2: You're a Junior(3rd year)

Alright, now if you are a junior(3rd year) then you are either following some major or have an area you like. The workload you probably have now far exceeds what you were used to during the first two years in university. So prioritizing tasks would be an intelligent way to go about it. This all depends on these factors,

1. `Your GPA`. Ask yourself the question "_is my GPA good?_", what do I mean by **good**. Imagine a worse case scenario, where you perform extremely poorly during some examination, then what is the capacity of your GPA to buffer the new results such that your **class**(_I am assuming you have some class, if not you should really focus on your grades_) is still maintained.
2. `You have some idea of what you like, but you definitely know what you don't like`. This is the building block of deciding whether a switch to some other field is necessary or not. Most of the time its really hard to find what we like, but more often than not a simple **process of elimination**  can get us very close. In my case I remember my _sub-fields I didn't like in physics(like astronomy)_ kept on increasing and where as I remember being drawn to all the `Computer Science` courses I took.
3. `When will you apply for grad school?`. This all depends on you, either you can apply during 4th year or wait until you have a complete transcript.
