Hi All!! In todays' post I will again be presenting findings from one of my own research work I completed as part of my PhD. The entire premise of this work revolves around a popular sub-field in Machine Learning called, [Adversarial Machine Learning](). It's no suprise that Machine Learning and Deep Learning models are capable of acomplishing a varying range of real-world complex tasks, from image recognition, time series prediction and playing games like GO. However, in recent years researchers have found that even though AI as a whole are pretty great, they do suffer from certain issues.

+ intro
    - adversarial AI
    - system log anomaly detection & models that work
    - the adversarial attack
        - the attack method
        - Reinforcement Learning as an Attack
            : write about main components and why we chose them
            : why reinforcement learning -> what kind of RL? why?

+ images
    - system log anomlay detection
    - attack example (logs) 
    - attack example (images)
    - distributed system log anomaly detection
    - model


##### So until next time,
##### Cheers!
