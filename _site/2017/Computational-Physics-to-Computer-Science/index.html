Sorry I was MIA <strong>:)</strong>, as you all probably know if you read my previous posts I’ve just started grad school and while everything I learn here is extremely interesting it’s kind of a grind so I haven’t had time to write anything new. Now coming back to my post a lot of my friends and students from my home country Sri Lanka have been asking about my experience about switching fields from Computational Physics to Computer Science. To those who don’t know I have a bachelors degree in Computational Physics and I switched to Computer Science for my PHD.</p> <p>This post is for you if you’re a <strong>student following a bachelors degree or someone who just finished a degree and planing to apply for grad school, but don’t really like your current field and wants to switch</strong>. Now first of all switching fields is not an easy thing, and it requires a lot of planing and preparation. But thats not the hardest part, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hardest part is deciding that you want to switch</code>. Because most everyone you will meet or ask advice from would tell you it’s risky and hard. <strong>Yes</strong> it is <em>risky and hard</em> but not impossible. I decided for my own personal reasons to switch fields back in 2015 and it was one of the best decisions I’ve taken so far amidst a bunch of horrible ones.</p> <blockquote> <p>Disclaimer: like any form advice, what I’ll be telling today is 30% actual advice and 70% from my own experience. So some things may or may not apply to you, so do take everything with a grain of salt.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now back to my post. If you <em>googled</em> a bit on <code class="highlighter-rouge">steps for applying for a PHD</code> you would get a considerable number of results containing a lot of useful advice. However, its my opinion that the same approach doesn’t work for everyone simply because we are at different stages of life(<em>by life I mean different years at university</em>) when we do decide to apply for a PHD. So depending on what stage of your bachelors degree the approach to prepare for the application process would change. Now obviously I’ll be making some assumptions about you, since even my advice shouldn’t be applied to all cases.</p> <h2 id="assumptions-about-you">Assumptions about you</h2> <ol> <li>You really <em>really</em> want to do a PHD. This ones a given, because if you didn’t you wouldn’t be reading this.</li> <li>You are thinking of switching fields, but unsure if thats possible. Now, what I’ll be telling will relate mostly to a switch to <strong>Computer Science</strong>, but some of it might be applicable to other fields as well.</li> <li>You are a student following a bachelors degree(<em>maybe masters, but it’s geared towards bachelors more</em>) <strong>OR</strong> just completed one.</li> </ol> <h3 id="case-1--youre-a-freshman-1st-year-or-a-sophomore-2nd-year">Case 1 : You’re a Freshman (1st year) or a Sophomore (2nd year)</h3> <p>If you are a Sophomore or a Freshman my biggest advice is to focus on grades. There is a debate about the influence GPA has on your application. Because most PHD candidates would agree that grades alone wouldn’t be enough. Now heres the catch, GPA has a disproportional impact on your application. Say you have an amazing GPA(4.0/4.0), thats great while it wouldn’t ensure you’re success at getting in it certainly is positive. However lets say your GPA is 2.0/4.0 then it definitely would have a negative impact on your application.</p> <p>GPA isn’t really a measure of your intelligence(<em>well to a certain extent it is</em>), but its more an indication of your dedication and capacity to plan and work. PHDs aren’t achieved in a couple of months, it usually takes years. So they definitely check for an applicants ability to persevere. Your cumulative GPA is a summation of 4 years, and the fact that you have been able to maintain it shows you have <strong>focus</strong> and thats essential for a PHD.</p> <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">In a nutshell if you are a freshman or Sophomore focus on your grades</code>. You don’t need to worry about what area you want to apply for or the universities you’d want to attend for grad school. Because a lot of things change, I remember back when I was in 1st year I wanted to specialize in <strong>chemistry</strong> and look where I am now. :)</p> <h2 id="case-2-youre-a-junior3rd-year">Case 2: You’re a Junior(3rd year)</h2> <aside class="share"> <p>If you liked this article and think others should read it, please <a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=From Computational Physics to Computer Science&amp;url=http://localhost:4000/2017/Computational-Physics-to-Computer-Science/&amp;via=" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'twitter-share', 'width=550,height=235');return false;">share it on Twitter <i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#00aced"></i></a> or <a href='https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u='+url; onclick="window.open(this.href, 'sharer', 'toolbar=0,status=0,width=550,height=235');return false;">Facebook <i class="fa fa-facebook-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#3b5998"></i></a>.</p> </aside> </div> </article> <!-- --> <footer class="site-footer"> <!--<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/icons/academicons-1.8.0/css/academicons.css"/>--> <div class="container"> <small class="block"><!--&lt;/&gt; <a href="http://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace" title="a minimalist Jekyll theme for technical writing">Thinkspace theme</a> by <a href="http://heiswayi.github.io">Heiswayi Nrird</a>. |--><i class="fa fa-copyright"></i> 2017 Dinal Herath</small> <a href="mailto:dinal.bing@gmail.com"><i class="fa fa-envelope" style="font-size:21px;color:#2294bd;"></i></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dinalHerath" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square" style="font-size:22px;color:#2294bd"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/dherath" target="blank"><i class="fa fa-github-square" style="font-size:22px;color:#2294bd"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerome-dinal-herath-bba3b0148/" target="blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square" style="font-size:22px;color:#2294bd"></i></a> <a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-rss-square" style="font-size:22px;color:#2294bd"></i></a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dinal_Herath" target="blank"> <i style="font-size:25px;color:#2294bd;font-weight:bold;"> RG </i></a> </div> </footer> </main> </body> </html>
