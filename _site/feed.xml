        <title>Simulation of a serial snake robot</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dherath/WebsiteMaterial/master/2017/post_2_serial_snake_robot/gazebo.png&quot; alt=&quot;gazebo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been fascinated by robots and well snakes. When it came to selecting a theme for my undergraduate research project I naturally ended up selecting an option which fits well with both. What started out as a research project sort of ended up being one my hobbies, so I’ll time and again update on my snake robot progress through my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now first to start off, essentially what I have been trying to do is to replicate serpentine motion in robots using simulations. Note that none of the methods I have developed have been experimentally tested. Maybe I’ll do it someday but there is still a long way to go before that… u’ll see why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prerequisites-skip-if-youve-used-gazebo-or-know-some-robotics&quot;&gt;Prerequisites (Skip if you’ve used Gazebo or know some robotics)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I go further into what I’ve done, here are some things you’ll need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All my simulations were carried out using &lt;strong&gt;Gazebo&lt;/strong&gt;, an open source software platform widely used in robotic simulations. Simulations are a cool way of testing out new ideas with minimal cost, and  its way more cooler since it involves robots. If you’ve never used Gazebo then click &lt;a href=&quot;http://gazebosim.org&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The official website has all the instruction on how to install Gazebo and tutorials on how to get started.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also you’ll need to have some idea about robotics in general. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Applied-Robotics-Kinematics-Dynamics/dp/1441917497&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Theory of Applied Robotics: Kinematics, Dynamics and Control&lt;/a&gt; is a great book you could use as a reference, but for now just knowing how to use Gazebo would be sufficient to understand what I’ve done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Hello World :)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everyone, My name is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dinal Herath&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and welcome to my blog. Here I’ll  essentially be writing about projects I work on , my experiences and well anything I feel I’d be interested to read on-line. I’m natively from &lt;strong&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/strong&gt; a beautiful tropical island in the middle of the Indian ocean. If you don’t know anything about Sri Lanka  click 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://bestoflanka.com/best-things-to-do-in-sri-lanka.php&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; if your planning you’re next vacation to a tropical paradise you should definitely visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a graduate from &lt;strong&gt;University of Colombo with a specialization in Computational Physics&lt;/strong&gt; and now in the processes of migrating to &lt;em&gt;Computer Science&lt;/em&gt; for my PHD. This being the case most of the projects I work on would have some code in them, so ill be posting links to my github for anyone who wants to work on them more. This blog will probably be the place where Ill share most of the experiences that I’m bound to face while I make this transition and I hope would probably help anyone out there, who like me would want to switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, my first blog post :).  I guess thats a sufficient introduction about what my blog will be all about :) I hope you find the upcoming posts informative and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cheers&quot;&gt;Cheers!&lt;/h4&gt;
