<!--Currently, I am part of the [SVR Lab](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~pyang/seclab.html) @ SUNY Binghamton under the supervision of Professor [Ping Yang](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~pyang/) and Professor [Guanhua Yan](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~ghyan/) where my current research focuses on improving the intersection between **`Applied Machine Learning (ML)`** and **`Cybersecurity`**. From a ML perspective I work on, 
+ **`Adversarial machine learning`** that focuses on the robustness for AI in cybersecurity
+ **`Interpretable machine learning`** that focuses on interpreting and understanding AI in cybersecurity

During my PhD, I have developed a method that explains malware classification made by **graph neural networks**, designed a real-time adversarial evasion attack using **deep reinforcement learning** that can be used to evaluate the robustness for deep learning based anomaly detection from distributed system logs, and also developed a model with real-time **anomaly detection** capability for scientific workflows. I have also worked on research projects which utilize **`Ethereum-Blockchain`** for building secure, distributed systems. -->


I currently work as a **`Security Data Scientist`** at **`Obsidian Security, USA`**. I like working on **applied machine learning problems** spanning the areas of anomaly detection, time series and graph-based tasks.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of Professor [Ping Yang](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~pyang/) and Professor [Guanhua Yan](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~ghyan/) at the State University of New York (SUNY)-Binghamton, USA. My research there focused on improving the intersection between **`Applied Machine Learning (AML)`** and **`Cybersecurity`**, with a focus on **adversarial** and **interpretable** machine learning. Before that I completed my Bachelors Degree in Science (BS) specializing in Computational Physics from the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka.

Before my PhD-I worked on research projects spanning the areas of wireless communications and robotics. During which, I gained experience in Markovian modeling, Deep Learning and Robotic simulations. As of August 2020 I am also a member of the [International Research Council (IRC) in Sri Lanka](https://medium.com/@SustainableEduF/meet-sri-lankan-researcher-jerome-dinal-herath-dd4a2614e9da).
