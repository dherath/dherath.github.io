Hi! <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true" style="font-size:19px;color:#2294bd"></i> I'm **Jerome Dinal Herath**(_everyone calls me Dinal_). I'm a computer science PHD candidate at State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton where my main research focus is in [Real-time Machine Learning](). I completed my bachelors degree in science from University of Colombo, Sri Lanka specializing in computational physics. _Click_ to follow my blog updates

### Research

Currently, I am part of the [SVR Lab](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~pyang/seclab.html) @ SUNY Binghamton under the supervision of Professor [Ping Yang](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~pyang/) and co-supervision of Professor [Guanhua Yan](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~ghyan/) where my current research focuses is in **`Real-time Machine Learning`**. I primarily develop machine learning models for real-time anomaly detection. Additionally, I also collaborate on research projects which utilize **`Ethereum-Blockchain`** for building secure, distributed systems. 

In terms of past research experience, before my PhD-I have worked on research projects spanning the areas of wireless communications and robotics. During which, I gained experience in Markovian modeling, Optimizations, Deep Learning and Robotic simulations.


In previous research projects I have mainly focused on wireless communications while during my undergrad days I was part of the robotics research group where I simulated different movement algorithms for biologically inspired snake robots. If you're interested in my work please visit my research gate page, where I'd be happy to share my work with anyone interested.
