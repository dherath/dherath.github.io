Currently, I am part of the [SVR Lab](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~pyang/seclab.html) @ SUNY Binghamton under the supervision of Professor [Ping Yang](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~pyang/) and Professor [Guanhua Yan](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~ghyan/) where my current research focuses on improving the intersection between **`Machine Learning (ML)`** and **`Cybersecurity`**. From a ML perspective I work on **`adversarial machine learning`** (i.e. "are ML models used for anomaly detection robust? can they be fooled?) and **`interpretable machine learning`** (i.e., "Why/How do ML models for anomaly detection really work?") 

In my PhD, so far I have worked on developing a model with real-time anomaly detection capability, we also tested its ability to provide anomaly root-causes. This was followed by our recent work on understanding the adversarial robustness of Deep Learning based models used for anomaly detection from distributed system logs. Additionally, I have also worked on research projects which utilize **`Ethereum-Blockchain`** for building secure, distributed systems. 

In terms of past research experience, before my PhD-I have worked on research projects spanning the areas of wireless communications and robotics. During which, I gained experience in Markovian modeling, Optimizations, Deep Learning and Robotic simulations. As of August 2020 I am also a member of the [International Research Council (IRC) in Sri Lanka](https://medium.com/@SustainableEduF/meet-sri-lankan-researcher-jerome-dinal-herath-dd4a2614e9da).
